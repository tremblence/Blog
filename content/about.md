What up homies!

My name is Justin, I'm from California.

I realized at some point years ago I love to travel and explore, even if just to the other end of town on a longboard.

Apart from a couple family trips, I hadn't traveled much until I went to Costa Rica to study abroad in 2012. It was an amazing experience. I lived with a local Costa Rican family for 4 months and immersed myself into their culture. Iguanas walked around like little dragons and pounced on fresh mangos. The ocean is perfectly warm/cool and there are sooo many tropical animals. 

The semester ended I didnâ€™t want to go home yet. I ended up staying another four months working and surfing along the pacific coast. It was hard to leave. I discovered the joy of traveling and knew this was only the beginning.

In 2015 I embarked on an open-ended voyage. Starting with a west coast road trip (San Diego to Seattle) and ending up in Florida, Colombia, New York, Israel, Netherlands, Nicaragua and back to Costa Rica. It was 9 months of pure going with the flow. I feel blessed to have had these experiences. Now I want to share my stories and advice to you!
