<p>What up homies!</p>
<p>My name is Justin, I'm from California. </p>

<p>I realized at some point years ago I loved to travel and explore, if even to the other end of town on a longboard. </p>

<p>
Apart from a couple family trips to Austria and Hawaii, I hadn't traveled much until I went to Costa Rica to study abroad in 2012. It was an amazing experience. I lived with a local Costa Rican family for 4 months and immersed myself into their culture. Iguanas walked around like little dragons and pounced on mango that dropped from the tree above. Tropical birds perched high above. The Pura Vida life is paradise.</p>
<p> The semester ended I didnt want to go home yet. I ended up staying another four months working and surfing along the pacific coast. It was hard to leave. I realized the joy of traveling and knew this was only the beginning. Just a few years later and I have spent more time in amazing countries that I would have thought. After graduating from college I went on an open-ended trip starting with a west coast road trip and ending up in Florida, Colombia, New York, Israel, Netherlands, Nicaragua and back to Costa Rica. Over 9 months I experienced so much for so little. I feel blessed to have had these experiences. Now I want to share my stories and advice to you!
