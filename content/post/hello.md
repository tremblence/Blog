Every time I travel, I overpack something

Normally its a shirt I thought I'd wear but didn't
or even a pair of shoes or extra bar of soap

On my most recent trip, I packed a medium school-sized backpack with enough stuff for 3 weeks in Costa Rica. I knew from past trips that on the coast in February, its very warm day and night and I wouldn't wear a shirt much since most days I would be surfing or at a festival.

With that in mind I packed 2 shorts, 2 tanktops and a pair of flipflops. It ended up being more than enough for the trip, considering I hardly wore a shirt at all, even when I slept. 
Granted- I prefer to not wear a shirt on the beach when its very hot outside and I'm surfing

Of course if you are headed to Amsterdam you might want more than a tanktop. I learned the hard way, but reducing your backpack size/weight can make your trip a lot easier and relaxing

So here is my guide for Packing SUPER Light. I understand and expect most people to pack more than these essentials but nonetheless here we go.
